# CustomerChurnPrediction
This project aims to predict if a customer will exit the Company Tesco (churn) or not (non-churn) given 20 attributes such as gender, senior citizen status, contract type, payment method, etc. 

Customer Churn prediction has significant business relevance as customer acquisition is more complex and resource-heavy when compared to customer retention. Analysing customer behaviour can help organisations establish personalised customer loyalty and retention programs. 

The dataset has been sourced from Kaggle and contains 7043 rows and 21 columns. As part of the project, 
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and Data preprocessing with pandas, sci-kit learn and seaborn libraries on Python. 
Implemented supervised ML techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifier. 
Achieved an F1-score of 0.87 on test data. 

Language: Python 3
